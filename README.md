# Usago
Library that abstracts away and manages RabbitMQ connections and channels,
seamlessly handling temporary connection issues in the background and provides
an interface that is stable between reconnections for developers to use

## Why did I build this?
Because I just thought of the name first and felt it's too perfect to not do
this..... Also I needed a rabbit mq library where I can abstract away conneciion
issues

## What's the name?
Usagi means rabbit in Japanese so it's a pun with rabbit + go
